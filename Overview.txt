 Two players take turns placing tiles on a game-board of size n × n.
The goal is for a player to place n of their tiles in the same row, column, or diagonal of the board.
However, at least k positions on the board need to be empty, where k is a value specified before the
game starts. After the players have placed n−k tiles on the board, so that there are exactly k empty
positions on the board, and no player has won then the players take turns sliding one of their tiles
into an adjacent empty position; tiles can be slid horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
If the number of empty positions is k and on their turn a player does not have any tiles adjacent
to the empty positions of the board the game ends in a draw.
The program will play against a human opponent. 
	- The human player uses blue tiles and always starts the game. 
	- The computer uses red tiles
